# README
This script check which is the free book of the day in the Packt Publishing.

Everyday there are new books, and they are usually good books, so it's good to keep and eye in it. This script is to automate it!

# USAGE
I made it using Python, it should be usable in both Python 3 and Python 2. Just execute the script they way you like and it will print the new book name.
